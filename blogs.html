      Sarting in the next school year of 2023-2024, Allen High School students will no longer be able to use personal devices at school, and instead being forced to used a school-issued device. I can see the reason of this action, being that preventing personal devices make it easier to cheat on assignments. However, most cheating that I know of doesn't even require the use of a personal device. In turn, making students use a school-issued device doesn't solve anything. Instead, it will simply lower the morale of students by not restricting their access to so many sites and services. Students should be able to access what they want to and how they want to.
