      <p class="pheading"><b>Merge Sort</b></p>
      <p class="pmain">
	Merge sort is a sorting algorithm which takes an array and splits into single element arrays, then merges the smaller arrays into larger sorted arrays until all subarrays are merged, leaving a sorted array. Merge sort usually uses two functions: a merge function, and a split function. </p>
      <p class="psubheading">
	<b>Merge Function</b>
      </p>
      <p class="pmain">
	The merge function takes two smaller arrays and combines them into one sorted array. First, it starts with combining the single element arrays. Since every single element array is technically sorted, every subsequent merged array will also be sorted. Due to this, the merge function has a simple method to merging larger arrays. It has two pointers which start at the beginning of each array. It checks whether the left index or the right index is smaller. Which ever is smaller is appended into the new merged array. Then, the pointer where the smaller number was is increased by one. When both indexes reach the end, the merged array is finished.
      </p>
      <p class="psubheading">
	<b>Sort Function</b>
      </p>
      <p class="pmain">
	The sort fuction takes am array, and then splits it into two smaller arrays if the array entered has a count greater than one. It then uses the merge function to merge the smaller arrays together. It evokes itself recursively until the arrays reach the size of one, then each recurively evoked sort function merges the smaller arrays until the original sort function merges the final two arrays into each other, leaving a sorted array.
