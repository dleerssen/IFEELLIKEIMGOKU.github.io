      <p style="font-size: 130%"><b>Artificial Intelligence Today</b></p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%">
	Artificial Intelligence has come into a golden age with programs like OpenAI&#8242s DALL&#8211E 2, which can &#8220create realistic images and art from a description in natural language&#8221 (OpenAI 2022). With these new AI programs producing more impressive results, many have begun to wonder how AI will affect the future. Sentient AI may become so powerful in the future that it could disregard the need for humans, and there is valid concern. Sentient AI could lead to mankind&#8242s downfall because of its goal&#8211oriented nature and the lack of regard for human life.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%"><b>Goal Oriented Programs</b></p>  
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%">
	AI is obviously based on coding, which typically means that these coded programs are goal oriented. This means that AI will do things in order to accomplish a specified goal. AI will &#8220choose the easiest and simple methods to achieve their goals&#8221 (Kaonga 2019). This is what humans do as well, using problem&#8211solving skills to complete a task in the easiest way possible. This makes sense if taken at a glance, but the problem arises when you look at it more closely. Professor Stuart Russell explains that &#8220In order to stop robots potentially destroying the human race,... scientists could change the way AI is engineered so it doesn&#8242t focus on a goal&#8211orientated mindset&#8221 (Kaonga 2019).
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%"><b>Lack of Regard for Human Values</b></p>  
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%">
	This is a problem because of an AI&#8242s lack of interest in human values. When AI would become sentient, unless coded very particularly, it could have bad feelings towards humans, or not take human life into account when pursuing its goals. A good example of this was created by Paul Christiano, who conjured a situation of a Nike robot whose goal was to maximize profits, so in order to do so, it would find killing Reebok customers to be a very effective solution (Matthews 2019). This seems a bit extreme, almost comical, but it illustrates how robots could lack the care for human life, and therefore lead to many human deaths.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%">
	Now whether or not AI could ever get this point can never be known for sure. But with the technology of the past growing exponentially into today, it's probable. Humans could also restrict themselves to creating AI not stronger than humans, so that they could not overpower us. Nevertheless, it is wise to be slightly weary of Sentient Robots, as they could lead to something terrible in the distant future.
