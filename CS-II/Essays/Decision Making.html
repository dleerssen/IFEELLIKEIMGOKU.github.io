      <p style="font-size: 130%; text-align:center"><b>What is Bias?</b></p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%; line-height:2">
	There is an interesting quirk in the human mind that hinders the ability to make intellectual decisions. Certain situations and circumstances around us make it hard to decide clearly. It’s very easy to focus on the benefits, forgetting the negatives, or to only consider what’s right in front of you. These traits are especially apparent in group decision making, and it’s important to combat these biases and choose what’s right. For my Independent Study Project (ISP) this year, there will be several biases that we will have to overcome in order to benefit our work, including authority, conformity, anchoring, availability, and confirmation. 
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%; text-align:center"><b>Authority and Conformity Bias</b></p>  
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%; line-height:2">
	It is certain that one member of the group will turn into a group leader of sorts, as someone will have great leadership skills or have a harder work ethic. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, however it comes with the caveat of authority bias. As the name implies, it is “the inclination we have to follow the instructions of an authority figure without questioning their goals or methods” (Mathers, 2022). Conformity bias is also apparent in our situation, as conformity is when “our deep-seated need to belong causes us to adapt our behaviors to feel like part of the group” (Caccavale, 2021), in other words following the majority. These could apply to the way in which we code our project, or how we divide up the work between group members. It could be that the majority or the group leader decides something, and that idea is followed and it ends up being wrong. However, it is important to remind each other that each group member’s ideas are as important as any other group member’s. We need to take each idea into consideration equally in order to prevent these biases. Simply put, to avoid this type of bias, we need to be “aware of it” (Mathers, 2022).
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 130%; text-align:center"><b>Confirmation, Availability, and Anchoring Bias</b></p>  
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%; line-height:2">
	Biases are not just about listening to others, but also ideas that are precedent in our own mind. A good example of this is Confirmation bias, which “occurs from the direct influence of desire on beliefs” (Heshmat, 2015). This could be represented as a group member using many global variables because he believes that they are very useful, however he does not consider the consequences of using them in large coding projects. In order to avoid this bias, both sides of an idea need to be taken into account, ways to “prove that you are wrong” (Heshmat, 2015) and ways to prove that you are right, and it needs to be determined whether it's right or wrong based on that thinking. The idea could also fall into the bias of availability. Availability bias is “a cognitive bias in which you make a decision based on an example, information, or recent experience that is readily available to you” (Gleason, 2021). Our group will need to try new ways to solve problems if current ways are not working. But these precedent thoughts can also apply to people in our group, with the anchoring bias. This is a “cognitive bias that causes people to rely too much on the first piece of information they get” (Dean, 2021). This could apply to information or first impressions of group members, and could be detrimental to our collaboration. To avoid this, We will solve this by ignoring first impressions, and instead treating everyone in the group equally no matter how we think of them.

      <p style="font-size: 130%; text-align:center"><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px; font-size:130%; line-height:2">
	Bias is part of our human nature, and it's impossible to truly avoid. However, it can be mostly stifled by taking measures to prevent it. With most biases, the best way to combat them is to think metacognitively about your decisions. Imagine how and why your ideas came to fruition and how these ideas will impact the situation. For me and my group, we will prevail through the biases and create our ISP by working collaboratively, taking everyone’s idea into account and creating new innovative solutions to our problems.
