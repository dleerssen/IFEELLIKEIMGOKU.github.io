      <p class="pheading"><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p class="pmain">
	What does the S stand for in HTTPS? It stands for secure, and websites use fingerprints to stay secure. However, this system is not perfect, and there are flaws with fingerprints. This essay will discuss what fingerprints are, how they work, and some problems with fingerprints.</p>
      <p class="pheading"><b>Purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection, hashes and &#34;good&#34; hashes, and CAs</b></p>  
      <p class="pmain"> 
	The two primary purposes of fingerprints are to &#8220;know that we are really connected to our bank, our records database, or any other public or private website&#8221; and &#8220;network traffic monitoring&#8221; (Gibson 2020). What are fingerprints? Explained in simple terms, fingerprints are a website&#8242;s unique hash. It&#8242;s a string of hexadecimal numbers that is different for every website. If even one bit is changed in the website&#8242;s file, then the fingerprint will change by 50% on average (Gibson 2020). Each hash can be approved by a CA, or Certificate Authority, who is a person or company that specializes in &#8220;issuing digital certificates that can verify identities&#8221; (Keyfactor, 2022). Basically, these certificates state that the website is safe and trustable. So if someone were to copy google&#8242;s website exactly, but under a different domain, then they would not have a certificate, therefore users can know not to use that website.</p>
