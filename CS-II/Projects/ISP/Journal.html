	  I did not make any commits or changes to the Model Scheduler during these two weeks, and my grade should reflect as such. However, I want to say that this group was managed in a way which was very difficult to contribute anything. The Project Manager (I think that this person is supposed to give out jobs I could be remembering wrong) gave out jobs only one time—as stated in the 6-Feb journal—and I completed the job that I was given, giving <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-ModelScheduler/commits?author=IFEELLIKEIMGOKU">these three most recent commits</a>. Since then, I have been given 0 tasks todo, along with several other of my groupmates. The only issues opened in the month of March was by our teacher, Mr. Ben Yakkov, so I couldn't fix issues either. There is definetly things that I could have improved on with figuring out how our sheduler works and what to do in order to help the project, but I was given close to 0 tasks to complete throughout the entire ISP.

	  <b>Technical Challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  This week I was assigned to redesign the login page for our MVP. The original design was very odd, so I adjusted the colors and added some images and text to make it more clear and likeable. he challenge was learning what complicated CSS was used to create gradients and where the CSS was stored. For example, I had to learn sub classes in CSS and even then, it was inconsistent whether the CSS would be in th actual CSS file or in the HTML file.

	  <b>Scheduling Challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  Scheduling improved significantly this week, with actual assignments being assigned to each member of the group with a due date of the assignment. Although some were simple, actually using the workforce of the group allowed for a lot more to get done. There was a slight issue where I wasn't given an assignment at first because of there being two Devons, but things were sorted out and I was given a task.

	<p style="text-indent:10px">
	  <b>Interpersonal challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  As stated previously, communications were good with teammates getting tasks to do. In turn, the Discord became a lot more active, with team members asking about the projects and figuring out how it works. No one really argued this week that I know of, so not really and challenges this week.

	  I have been assigned the task to redesign the login page for the Model Scheduler. Personally, I find it annoying to have a login page. If I was the student using the scheduler I would be furious for being forced to login everytime I want to try a new schedule. Anywasys, I will work on this task this weekend.

	  Things have gotten a lot better since the last journal on 23-Jan-2023. Tasks have been created and assigned to each person in the group to utilize our full workforce. This is very important for our grades for the participation and it will make this project completed a lot faster.

	  <b>Interpersonal challenges</b>

	<p class="pentry">
	  As stated previously, relations have been better because our whole team is now being incorporated into the project. The only thing really being argued about right now is the login system, however it's non-negotiable because our CS teacher requires us to implement it.

	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  Apparently an MVP has already been created, and it was collaborated so poorly that I did not even know of its construction. My technical problems are not knowing what is going on at all. I learned the basics of SQL from the lessons in class, but I am so behind on our project. I will try to catch up and communicate better with teammates.

	<p style="text-indent:10px">
	  <b>Scheduling Challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  No meetings at all were scheduled at all this week, and being in a class with no groupmates makes it difficult to communicate verbally. On Discord, people are talking but again I'm so behind that it's hard to understand. I feel bad because I really want to help but I have no idea how to contribute.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent:10px">
	  <b>Interpersonal challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  Same as last week, group seems to have split with one side being 14 people not doing anything while 4 people do all the work. They are talking about attempting to give tasks to people now but still nothing yet. I don't doubt that this project will turn out great because of the very talented and dedicated members in the group, but I just hope that they help the people that are behind.

	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  The group did not do much coding this week, it was mainly scoping out what the website would look like. This does not concern the back-end group, as we are concerned with the database and rest api.

	<p style="text-indent:10px">
	  <b>Scheduling Challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  There has only been one meeting so far and it was planned 1 hour before it happened, so I could not attend it. The only communication possible is through Discord, and the group is not very communicative. The group leaders responsible for giving out jobs are doing a very poor job by not using the workforce at all.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent:10px">
	  <b>Interpersonal challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  Again, no taks or issues have been assigned to anyone, and the group leaders have just started working on their own and not including anyone else. They did a lot of prior research to this project, so they have a level of intellect above everyone else, making it very difficult to understand what they're doing. And they aren't really explaining what they're doing at all.

	  <b>Technical Challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  There were not many prevalent technical challenges in this week of our ISP. This is because we have mainly focused on deciding roles and creating our Github issues. The only technical issue I encountered was figuring out how to add my issues to the main pinboard, which I figured out relatively quickly.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent:10px">
	  <b>Scheduling Challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  Scheduling is extremely difficult when you have 22 people in your group, so a main meeting has not commenced yet. There was one planned on Wednesday, however I could not attend as it was too short-noticed. Hopefully we will plan meetings better in the future, or we could plan online meetings in Discord so that it is more accessible.
	</p>
	<p style="text-indent:10px">
	  <b>Interpersonal challenges</b>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  Interpersonal challenges were a huge problem during this week. There is a certain individual, who I wish I could name, who is very aggressive and extremely difficult to work with. He is constantly berating group members for creating simple issues and just generally being an annoyance, always adding some snarky comment in issues or on Discord. I guess he doesn't realize that it is very difficult to create 66 unique, useful issues in one week before even starting the project. He has already gotten in several arguments with people over Discord over things things that don't really matter. I hope that he can come to his senses soon and start being a supportive and helpful teammate, because otherwise this project's team is going to be unbearable.

	  <b>Descriptions of jobs that My groupmates and I will have for our Independent Study Project</b> <br>
	</p>
	<p class="pentry">
	  <b>(Software) Development Engineer&#58;</b> This job will consist of deciding how and what to code for our project, and the engineer will choose the coding languages and programs, and how we use them to complete our project. I feel that I would not suit this role very well because I am not the most fluent or proficient in many coding languages, so someone who could explain the new programs and languages that we will need to use would be better suited for this job.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b>QA Engineer&#58;</b>  The Quality Assurance Engineer will be sure to check for errors and bugs in our programs in order to fix them, as well as fix sloppy or inefficient code. In the back-end of the model scheduler, they would need to check errors in our code with SQL and whether its efficient. A good person for this role would again be someone who is easily adaptable to new languages and is very proficient in coding.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b>Project Manager&#58;</b> The Project Manager will make sure that everyone is doing their work on time and that development is going to plan. In our group specifically, assigning projects to each individual in the group would be very important, as well as making sure that they complete their code on time. I feel that I would be more accustomed to this role than the others, as exact knowledge in coding is not exactly needed, however organizing and implementing projects would be difficult.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b>Product Manager&#58;</b> The Product Manager will have a similar job, but instead worrying about the release of the product and who the audience is for the product. For the model scheduler, I imagine that they will be concerned with making the project as accessible as possible for students, and obvious to navigate. They could also add funny "easter eggs" that students can find and laugh at. I would feel comfortable with this position as I would get friends to test our site and give feedback in order to improve the project.<br>
	  <br>
	  <b>Release Engineer&#58;</b> The release engineer will have a similar job as the software engineer, however more focused on creating the tasks that the project manager will give to team members. They will create the steps necessary to complete the model scheduler, basically making the step by step guide. I would not suit this role very well because I am not good at thinking of many different ways to approach a problem, and I get stuck on trying one process over and over again.<br>
